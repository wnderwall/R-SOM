# R-SOM
A project put together with a classmate Cem Tener (funny enough knows nothing about baseball) in the fall of my senior year experimenting with self-organizing maps using RStudio. It's a preliminary idea, but it helps to show what I can teach myself.

The idea behind the project was to learn more about machine learning due to the emphasis placed on the idea by the many executives and data scientists I talked to in the Baseball Operations industry. The project is rough but showcases what I can learn and teach myself in about a two-week period. This was not a final project or full semester project but was one of four basic projects we had for my Stat Computing with R class @ Kenyon. 

That being said, please check out the files listed. There is an R-Script file with all the coding, some preliminary analysis, and a PowerPoint file showcasing how we demonstrated our knowledge to the class.
